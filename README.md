note: The VelvetInk WaveForm and Bloom brush shaders have different include paths than the other tilt brush shaders.

#include "Assets/Tilt Brushes by Smew/UnitySDK/Assets/TiltBrush/Assets/Shaders/Include/Brush.cginc"
#include "Assets/Tilt Brushes by Smew/UnitySDK/Assets/ThirdParty/Noise/Shaders/Noise.cginc"

There are more VRC/Quest compatible shaders in here, I just haven't tested them all. I know the Ink splatter and toon works 
but the toon doesn't generate the 3D toon objects like it does in tilt brush at least not yet.
